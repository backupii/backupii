Upgrading Backup v3 to BackupII v0
==================================

In order to upgrade to BackupII from the old version of Backup, you need to
first upgrade to Backup v4.x, by following the [backup-upgrade] documentation.

It's recommended you update to the latest Backup v3.x release first, or be sure you
understand the changes since your current release.

Upgrading Backup v4/v5 to BackupII v0
=====================================

BackupII is a fork of the last release of Backup v5.0.0.beta.1, so BackupII v0.x
should be a drop-in replacement for Backup v4.x or v5.x, at the notable
exception of the name change. The binary name is now `backupii`
