Compressors
===========

Backup includes a [Gzip][compressor-gzip] and [Bzip2][compressor-bzip2] compressor,
as well as a [Custom][compressor-custom] compressor that can be configured to use most any compression utility.

Only one Compressor may be configured for each Model.

When a Compressor is configured, **all** [Archives][archives] and [Databases][databases] will be compressed.
